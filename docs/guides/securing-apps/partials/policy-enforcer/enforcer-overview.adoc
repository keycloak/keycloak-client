[[_enforcer_overview]]

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. {project_name} provides all the necessary means
to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments, and programming languages. {project_name} Authorization Services presents a RESTful API,
and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-grained authorization using a centralized authorization server.

A PEP is responsible for enforcing access decisions from the {project_name} server where these decisions are taken by evaluating the policies
associated with a protected resource. It acts as a filter or interceptor in your application in order to check whether or not a particular request
to a protected resource can be fulfilled based on the permissions granted by these decisions.

{project_name} provides built-in support for enabling the *{project_name} Policy Enforcer* to Java applications with built-in support to secure JakartaEE-compliant frameworks and web containers.
If you are using Maven, you should configure the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.keycloak</groupId>
    <artifactId>keycloak-policy-enforcer</artifactId>
    <version>${client_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

When you enable the policy enforcer all requests sent to your application are intercepted and access to protected resources will be granted
depending on the permissions granted by {project_name} to the identity making the request.

Policy enforcement is strongly linked to your application's paths and the link:{authorizationguide_link}#_resource_overview[resources] you created for a resource server using the {project_name} Administration Console. By default,
when you create a resource server, {project_name} creates a link:{authorizationguide_link}#_resource_server_default_config[default configuration] for your resource server so you can enable policy enforcement quickly.
