= Dedicated release cycle for the client libraries

From this release, some of the Keycloak client libraries will have release cycle independent of the Keycloak server release cycle. The 26.0.0 release may be the last one
when the client libraries are released together with the Keycloak server. But from now on, the client libraries may be released at a different time than the Keycloak server.

The client libraries are these artifacts:

* Java admin client - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client`
* Java authorization client - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-authz-client`
* Java policy enforcer - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-policy-enforcer`

It is possible that in the future, some more libraries will be included.

= Compatibility of the client libraries with the server

Beginning with this release, we are testing and supporting client libraries with the same server version and a few previous major server versions.
