# Checklist for merging PRs

See the [PR Checklist of the main Keycloak server repository](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/PR-CHECKLIST.md) 
for the info.

The keycloak-client currently does not have bot, so after merging PR, it is also good to doublecheck that related GH issue 
has correct milestone set to the upcoming version of keycloak client.
