summary="How to upgrade the {project_name} Client Libraries">

The client libraries are those artifacts:

* Java admin client - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client`
* Java authorization client - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-authz-client`
* Java policy enforcer - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-policy-enforcer`
* Java common classes used by other client libraries above - Maven artifact `org.keycloak:keycloak-client-common-synced`

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
The client libraries are supported with the last supported {project_name} server version.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
The client libraries are supported with all the supported {project_name} server versions. The fact that client libraries are supported with more server versions makes the update easier,
so you may not need to update the server at the same time when you update client libraries of your application.
endif::[]

It is possible that client libraries may work even with the older releases of the {project_name} server, but it is not guaranteed and officially supported.

It may be needed to consult the javadoc of the client libraries like Java admin-client to see what endpoints and parameters are supported with which {project_name} server version.
